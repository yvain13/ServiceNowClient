# ServiceNow Client for Python Demo

This repository showcases a **ServiceNow Client for Python** integration with a Colab notebook, demonstrating how you can interact with ServiceNow data, perform data analysis, and integrate AI-powered solutions. The notebook highlights the newly released ServiceNow Client for Python and introduces surprising new functionality for ServiceNow developers, AI engineers, and data enthusiasts.

## Features

- **pySNC Integration**: Efficient interaction with ServiceNow instances using Python’s `GlideRecord` API.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate dynamic visualizations to analyze trends, incidents, and more.
- **AI-Powered Data Exploration**: Use **LangChain + OpenAI** to query and explore your data using natural language.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Let the data "speak" using **Hugging Face’s TTS model** to summarize insights audibly.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pySNC` (for ServiceNow integration)
  - `LangChain` (for natural language queries)
  - `OpenAI` (for AI integration)
  - `Hugging Face` (for text-to-speech functionality)
  - Visualization libraries: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly`

## Installation

You can run this notebook in **Google Colab** or locally if you have the necessary setup. To get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/servicenow-python-client-demo.git
   cd servicenow-python-client-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook in Colab or your local environment:
   - Upload the notebook to **Google Colab** and start exploring.
   - For local execution, run the notebook in a Jupyter environment.

## Usage

1. **pySNC Integration**: Demonstrate querying and managing ServiceNow data using Python.
2. **Data Visualization**: Analyze your data and visualize trends.
3. **AI-Powered Data Exploration**: Use LangChain and OpenAI to query the data via natural language.
4. **Text-to-Speech**: Get data insights audibly with Hugging Face’s TTS.

The notebook is organized in cells that guide you through each functionality. Check the example outputs to see how to interact with your data!
